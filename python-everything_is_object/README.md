# Python - Everything is Object

## 🎯 Project Overview
Dive deep into Python's object-oriented nature! This project is your gateway to understanding how Python treats everything as an object, from simple integers to complex data structures. Through practical examples and thought-provoking exercises, you'll master the concepts of mutability, object identity, and memory management in Python.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- **Object Identity**: Understanding how Python manages memory and object references
- **Mutability**: Exploring the difference between mutable and immutable objects
- **Variable Assignment**: How Python handles variable assignments and aliasing
- **Function Parameters**: Understanding how Python passes objects to functions

## 🚀 Project Structure
The project is divided into several tasks that progressively build your understanding:

1. **Basic Object Operations**
   - Type identification
   - Memory address retrieval
   - Object identity comparisons

2. **Data Structure Exploration**
   - List mutability and operations
   - Tuple immutability
   - String behavior

3. **Advanced Concepts**
   - Function parameter passing
   - Object copying and cloning
   - Memory management

## 💻 Technical Requirements
- Python 3.8.5
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Pycodestyle 2.7.*
- All files must be executable
- Answer files must be single-line responses

## 📚 Learning Resources
- Python Documentation on Objects and Values
- Understanding Aliasing in Python
- Mutable vs Immutable Types
- Python's Memory Management
- List Cloning Techniques
- Tuple Behavior in Python

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, you'll be able to:
- Explain Python's object-oriented nature
- Differentiate between mutable and immutable objects
- Understand how Python manages memory
- Master variable assignment and aliasing
- Explain function parameter passing
- Work effectively with Python's built-in types

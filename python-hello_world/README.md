Python - Hello, World 🌍
Welcome to the Python world! This project is an introduction to Python programming, where you'll explore basic concepts, syntax, and style guidelines for writing clean Python code. It includes several beginner-friendly tasks that will help you get started with Python while following the PEP 8 style guide.

Author's Disclaimer
"You'll soon find that with Python (and the majority of higher-level languages), there are ten different ways to do the same thing. Some tasks will expect only one implementation, while other tasks will have multiple possible implementations. Don't worry if you see a warning when running PEP 8, you can ignore it. Enjoy the process!"
– Guillaume

A README.md file is required for this repository and project folder.
Tasks 📝
Here is a breakdown of the tasks in this project:

Hello, print
Write a Python script that prints:
"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle"

Print integer
Print an integer variable followed by Battery street. Use f-strings.

Print float
Print a float variable with a precision of 2 digits. Use f-strings.

Print string
Print a string 3 times, followed by the first 9 characters of the string.

Play with strings
Concatenate two strings to display:
"Welcome to Holberton School!"

Copy - Cut - Paste
Slice a word into parts and display the first 3 letters, last 2 letters, and the middle word.

Create a new sentence
Reorganize variables to display:
"object-oriented programming with Python"

Easter Egg
Write a script that prints "The Zen of Python" by Tim Peters.

Usage 💻
Run Scripts
To run any Python script in this project:

bash
